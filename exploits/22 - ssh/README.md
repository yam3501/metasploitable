There unfortunately nothing available in searchploit for this version.

lets have a look in metasploit:

There seems to be one auxiliary in metasploit meant for ssh-logins

In the options we see that we require a password file. So we create a dummy file using `crunch` and add the default credentials of metasploitable 2 in that file. Here is the command I used to create the dummy password file:
```
crunch 3 3 asdf1234 -t "@ @" -o wordlist.txt
```
